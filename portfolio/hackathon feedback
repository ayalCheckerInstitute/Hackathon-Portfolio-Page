First of all I must say that your code it's really clean and written well even that there is some parts that we 
can export to function like the admin route.
Regarding the frontend I'm sure that you could make it better, there is some bugs there like the images are not loaded.
I suggest you to continue working at the website to add some css and bootstrap.

Well done
